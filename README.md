### What is Black Friday ?
Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving. Retailers typically offer steep discounts on Black Friday to kick off the holiday season.Black friday is the one of the most profitable days for all the retailers and for the buyers too. It's common for retailers to offer special promotions and open their doors during the pre-dawn hours on Black Friday to attract customers.

To keep up with the competition, retailers need some insights and cluster of customers to segmantize and to target them. So, retailers can use different marketing strategies to attract different types of customers.

Data scientist can help retailers with proper insights based on the historical data of black friday and also give proper data driven solutions by using Data science methods and by following the **CRISP-DM Process (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining)**. Thus, they can achieve thier target/goal.This project is all about this.
